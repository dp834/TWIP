The goal of this project is to control a two wheeled inverted pendulum to implement control theories I'm learning in school.

Initial design will be done in Simulink with a mathematical model based on this paper
"K. Pathak, J. Franch and S. K. Agrawal, "Velocity and position control of a wheeled inverted pendulum by partial feedback linearization," in IEEE Transactions on Robotics, vol. 21, no. 3, pp. 505-513, June 2005, doi: 10.1109/TRO.2004.840905. "

Controls will be tested in Gazebo with ROS2 and eventually built into a real robot.
